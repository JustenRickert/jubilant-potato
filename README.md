First Commit Whoo!  So, yeah.  Basically I have a pretty basic
movement and collision system built right now.  Later I plan to add
more strategic varieties of movements, as well as attacks, and later
add companions which will fight by your side.  For the time being
though I think I'm going to work on a basic exp system, and hero level
system.
